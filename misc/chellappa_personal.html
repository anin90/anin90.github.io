<P>
Born in 1995 in Chennai. Did my schooling in Trichy & Durgapur. Went to 
an engineering college, just like most kids did. Not until final semester 
was I interested in anything scientific in my whole life. For my bachelor's 
thesis, I got to play with DNA & protein sequences of humans & monkeys. 
Thought this was pretty cool & planned to stick around doing this for a 
while.
<P>
Graduated in 2016. Joined an internship in a research laboratory in 
Bangalore. I had a mentor who made me understand the scientific process & 
how things work in academia. After spending ~18 months with him, at 
the bare minimum, I was able to formulate a research question, device a 
method, write a few lines of code, write a few words interpreting the 
results and communicate to an audience. During this time he also helped 
me gain access to the best of all computational facilities in the 
country, where I spent most of my time.
<P>
In late 2018, I joined a computational biology PhD program in a mental 
hospital in Bangalore. Supported by funds from an interesting multi-
institutional <a href="https://ncbs.res.in/adbs/">program</a>.
Supervised by a psychiatrist and a systems biologist. Now 
(Aug-2020) into 2nd year of my PhD.
